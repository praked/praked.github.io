Hello! I'm Pranav Kedia, a Ph.D. researcher at the <a href="https://www.cps.uni-konstanz.de/">cyber physical group</a> supervised by <a href="https://heikohamann.de/">Prof. Dr. Heiko Hamann</a> at the <a href="https://www.uni-konstanz.de/">University of Konstanz</a>, where I'm affiliated with the  <a href="https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/">Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour</a>. I am working on a swarm of autonomous sailboats optimized for long-duration endurance. This research has been a combination of learning about sailing and applying my skills and knowledge in Embedded systems and Robotics. Previously, I worked on Bee Waggle Robot in the EU H2020 project <a href="https://www.hiveopolis.eu/">'Hiveopolis'</a> at the <a href="https://bioroboticslab.github.io/website/">Biorobtics Lab</a> led by <a href="https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/inf/groups/ag-ki/members/Professoren/Tim_Landgraf.html">Prof. Dr. Tim Landgraf</a> at  the <a href="https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html">Free University of Berlin</a>.  I completed my master's majoring in electronics and communication with a specialization in embedded systems at <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">IIIT-B</a>. Previously, I was fortunate to be part of the <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/sarl/sarl.html">Surgical and Assistive Robotics Lab</a>, led by <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=madhavrao">Prof. Madhav Rao</a>. I was also part of the <a href="http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/robotics/people.html">ARMS  lab</a>, led by <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitb.ac.in/arpitasinha">Dr. Arpita Sinha</a> at IIT Bombay, India, in the summer of 2019. <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/sachit-rao">Prof. Sachit Rao</a> had supervised me on guided coursework and non-course projects.
  
I enjoy working on Bio-inspired Swarm Robotics and Swarm Intelligence methods. You can find details of my <a href="https://praked.github.io/publications/">Publications</a> and <a href="https://praked.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> here.

</p>

<h2 align="left"> Research and other interests</h2>
<p align="justify"> I am interested in multi-agent and swarm robotics and its applications, human-robot interaction. Building novel robots has always excited me.</p> 

<p align="justify"> Apart from my work, I enjoy traveling and learning about new cultures and languages. I like to find interconnections and variations of languages in different places. I love to sketch and paint. I am also an avid reader of world politics and history.
